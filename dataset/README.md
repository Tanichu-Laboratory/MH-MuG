We use classical and jazz pieces as training data for each agent. We collected 100 pieces from each genre from Musescore\footnote{https://musescore.com/}. Musescore is a platform where users can share musical scores and MIDI data, and each piece is labeled with information such as its genre and the instruments used. In this study, we selected only public-domain pieces that feature piano as the sole instrument for each genre.
